What is Barber Connect?
---

Barber Connect is a website and application that will be able to connect Barbers and customers easier than ever.
For Barbers, they can create a profile and showcase their work and what they're all about. Barbers will be able to post pictures 
of their work, create a bio to introduce themselves, post their schedule, prices they charge for a haircut, set up appointments to cut at their shop and even meet the customer. For customers, this app will be a much more seemless way of finding a local barber that they can trust by simply looking up a profile and even being able to choose if they want a haircut at home. This idea was inspired when I've always been able to find a barber shop, but never a barber that I could trust to give me that fresh haircut we all deserve.
